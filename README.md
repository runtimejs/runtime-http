## SYNOPSIS

HTTP protocol implementation for runtime.js (work in progress)

Design goals:

- pure JavaScript (ES6)
- built on top of runtime.js TCP sockets (ideally portable and supporting other backends like Node)
- high-performance and low-level, no stream abstractions
- fetch API frontend support
